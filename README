This is an Android version of the abstract paper-and-pencil game, Scribe, by Mark Steere.
Please see http://www.marksteeregames.com for rules and other implementations.

This game is still very rough, but go ahead and give it a try, and please send me
any comments or bug reports, by posting them on the github issue tracker, or 
emailing me at matrixfrog@gmail.com

Enjoy!
