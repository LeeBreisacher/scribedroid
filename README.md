This is an Android version of the abstract paper-and-pencil game, Scribe, by Mark 
Steere. Check out [Mark Steere's website](http://www.marksteeregames.com) for other 
implementations, including an actual Scribe board that you can print out. Like, 
on paper. I know, weird, right?

Thanks to Stack Overflow members AaronM and RaveDave for the

Dalton's [SuperDuperGames](http://superdupergames.org/) which is where I first 
discovered the game.

Please feel free to fork, hack, submit bugs and suggestions, all that good stuff.
